The topic that used to be here involved significant downtime when deploying to production and we realize that is not acceptable.

We're currently researching the best way to deploy Magento to production and when it's verified and tested, we'll publish that information here.

If you have input, we'd like to hear from you in [GitHub issue 419](https://github.com/magento/devdocs/issues/419).

Thanks for your patience.
